## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sruthijha :)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m currently pursuing a **Master's in Data Science (MS-DS)** at the University of Colorado Boulder. I enjoy turning data into meaningful insights and building projects that solve real-world problems.

When Iâ€™m not knee-deep in data, Iâ€™m the kind of person who starts movies but rarely finishes them, grooves to music like itâ€™s my side hustle, and sometimes stares at the sky wondering, *'When will the earth call it a day?'*. I love mixing creativity with logic and am always up for learning something new or solving unexpected problems.

Think weâ€™d click? Letâ€™s connect and create something impactful together!

## Hi there 👋 I'm Sruthijha :)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m currently pursuing a **Master's in Data Science (MS-DS)** at the University of Colorado Boulder. I enjoy turning data into meaningful insights and building projects that solve real-world problems.

When I’m not knee-deep in data, I’m the kind of person who starts movies but rarely finishes them, grooves to music like it’s my side hustle, and sometimes stares at the sky wondering, *'When will the earth call it a day?'* I love mixing creativity with logic and am always up for learning something new or solving unexpected problems.

Think we’d click? Let’s connect and create something impactful together!

### Fun Facts about me
- **Hardworking & Dedicated:** I dive into every project with determination and persistence, leaving no stone unturned (or dataset uncleaned). 
- **Disciplined & Focused:** When it’s time to work, I tune out distractions like a pro, unless there’s music playing, then I’m multitasking.
- **Creative & Thoughtful:** I enjoy finding unique solutions to challenges and making sure every detail is thoughtfully considered. 
- **Funny & Relatable:** I bring a dash of humor to everything I do because even data needs a good laugh sometimes!
- **All-In Attitude:** Whether it’s a project, a new skill, or a karaoke night I didn’t sign up for, I throw myself into it 100% (results may vary on the singing).

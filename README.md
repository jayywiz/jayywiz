## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sruthijha :)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m currently pursuing a **Master's in Data Science (MS-DS)** at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I turn raw data into pure gold (a.k.a. actionable insights) and craft projects that leave an impact bigger than a plot twist in a Christopher Nolan movie!

When Iâ€™m not knee-deep in data, Iâ€™m a curious soul who starts movies but rarely finishes them, grooves to music like itâ€™s a full-time gig, and occasionally stares at the sky pondering, *'When will the earth call it a day?'* I thrive on blending creativity with logic and am always up for a challengeâ€”or a fun fact showdown!

Think weâ€™d click? Letâ€™s connect and create something impactful together!

- **Hardworking & Dedicated:** I dive into every project with determination and persistence, leaving no stone unturned (or dataset uncleaned).

- **Creative & Thoughtful:** I enjoy finding unique solutions to challenges and making sure every detail is thoughtfully considered. 
- **Funny & Relatable:** I bring a dash of humor to everything I do because even data needs a good laugh sometimes!
- **All-In Attitude:** Whether itâ€™s a project, a new skill, or a karaoke night I didnâ€™t sign up for, I throw myself into it 100% (results may vary on the singing).
